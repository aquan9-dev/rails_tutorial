# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.

# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
myapp/.bundle

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
myapp/log/*
myapp/tmp/*
!myapp/log/.keep
!myapp/tmp/.keep

# Ignore pidfiles, but keep the directory.
myapp/tmp/pids/*
!myapp/tmp/pids/
!myapp/tmp/pids/.keep

# Ignore uploaded files in development.
myapp/storage/*
!myapp/storage/.keep
myapp/tmp/storage/*
!myapp/tmp/storage/
!myapp/tmp/storage/.keep

myapp/public/assets

# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
myapp/config/master.key
docker-compose.override.yaml
